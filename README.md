# README for mortgage-node

This is an app I wrote to track personal/private loans.  It's very rudemintary but is constantly (when time permits) getting upgraded.  One day I hope to be able to release it as a public site.  

The project has been a good learning ground for node.js, express, mongoDB/mongoose, and OAuth2.0 via auth-connect with Google.

In the meantime feel free to copy, comment, etc.  For my own use it is running on a single threaded heroku app with a small mongoDB database.  If interested in an example db file email chris.sgriffin@gmail.com.
You can view the site at http://mortgage-42.herokuapp.com, however there is no front-end for loan creation so you won't see much :-(

Happy coding!
